A CMS begun using a UDEMY tutorial and expanded since

## Introduction

This project was created from following a PHP course on UDEMY. It is my first dive into PHP language and working with databases in mySQL.
It is desinged to give a user (admin) control over what is present on the website, user accounts & comments whilst allowing other visitors (subscribers) create accounts, post blogs and post comments.

I followed this course as a way to learn PHP & mySQL and to begin understanding this server-side language better. 

### Technologies

This project uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.
Also used are Bootstrap, jQuery and Font Awesome.
Google Charts are used too.
